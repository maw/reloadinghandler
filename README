ReloadingHandler is a specialized HTTP request handler class to be
used with Python's various HTTP server modules.  It is a shim that
fits between the HTTP serving aparatus and your real handler that
reloads your real handler upon every request.  This makes developing
and debugging your server very fast: whenever you make a change, just
save your work and hit the server again -- no need to stop and restart
your server.  When your handler is debugged and ready for production
or benchmarking, only a simple change is necessary.

driver.py is a simple example of how to use the ReloadingHandler, and
MyHandler.py is a simple handler module/class.

TODO:

* MyHandler is currently kind of ugly in how it's structured.  Clean
  it up.  Ideally, it'd be necessary to provide just one class.

* Make it work with Python 3.
